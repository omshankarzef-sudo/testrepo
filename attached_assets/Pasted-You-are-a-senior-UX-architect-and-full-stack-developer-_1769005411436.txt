You are a senior UX architect and full-stack developer.

Redesign the ANALYTICS section of a School Management System Admin Panel.

The current analytics page feels cluttered.
Fix it by introducing a clean, role-based insight flow.

========================
CORE UX LOGIC (MANDATORY)
========================

The Analytics page must FIRST ask:
"What do you want to analyze?"

Provide an Insight Type selector at the top:
- Teacher Insights
- Student Insights

Only show data AFTER an option is selected.

========================
TEACHER INSIGHTS FLOW
========================

When "Teacher Insights" is selected:

🔹 Filters:
- Select Teacher (dropdown)
- Select Date Range (Today / Week / Month / Custom)

🔹 Summary Cards:
- Attendance Percentage
- Total Classes Taken
- Quizzes Created
- Leaves Taken
- Performance Rank
- Average Class Score

🔹 Detailed Sections:
- Attendance trend chart
- Classes assigned list
- Quiz activity breakdown
- Class-wise performance comparison

🔹 Alerts:
- Low attendance warning
- Missed classes
- No quizzes created in selected period

========================
STUDENT INSIGHTS FLOW
========================

When "Student Insights" is selected:

🔹 Filters:
- Select Class (mandatory)
- Select Student (optional)
- Select Date Range

------------------------

CASE 1: Class selected, Student NOT selected

Show Class Performance View:
- Class Average Score
- Class Attendance %
- Top 3 Students
- Lowest Performing Students
- Subject-wise performance chart

------------------------

CASE 2: Class AND Student selected

Show Individual Student Performance:
- Student Attendance %
- Total Quizzes Attempted
- Average Score
- Highest Score
- Lowest Score
- Subject-wise marks
- Performance trend chart

🔹 Student Alerts:
- Low attendance
- Poor performance trend
- Missed quizzes

========================

- Modern, premium UI
- Clear visual separation
- No mixed teacher/student data
